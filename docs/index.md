Ground is an open source, map-first data collection platform that enables users
to collect, map, and share data. Built from the ground up to support mobile data
collection, Ground syncs data seamlessly over internet connections that are only
occasionally available. The Ground team, made up of volunteers at Google and
contributors from the open source community, aspires to empower local
communities, researchers, NGOs, and other interest groups to collect data that
matters.

**Note:** Ground is not an officially supported Google product, and is developed
on a best-effort basis. If you would like to contribute to Ground development,
see the [Contribute](#contribute) section. If you have questions or ideas about
Ground that you'd like to share, post them to the
[ground-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ground-discuss)
discussion group.

# Features

*   **Offline First**: Mobility is crucial when collecting or verifying data in
    remote areas. Ground's offline mobile data collection and offline raster
    basemaps give users uninterrupted access to important data wherever they may
    be. Intelligent background data sync automatically applies changes and
    uploads new data when an internet connection is available.

*   **Flexible Data Collection**: Raster basemaps, photo, audio, and video
    attachments, custom forms and data validation, and other features, make
    Ground a great tool for collecting geospatial data on a wide range of
    domains. You can tune Ground to meet your needs, whether you're tracking
    malaria outbreaks or mapping animal habitats.

*   **Community Engagement**: Ground allows local communities, citizen
    scientists, and small to large enterprises to manage and own the entire
    process, from setting up and running a project, to visualizing and analyzing
    results. Collaboration features make small and large scale crowd-sourcing
    possible out of the box. This allows users to apply local knowledge at scale
    to produce otherwise inaccessible insights.

*   **Remeasurement**: Ground's unique data collection model not only allows
    collection of data in space, but also allows remeasurement of observations
    over time and/or by multiple users. Map and monitor glacial movements,
    community food and water resources, algae levels, and other dynamic data
    points.

# Use Cases

It's the Ground team's mission to make Ground adaptable to a broad range of
humanitarian, data-intensive, and geospatial use cases, such as:

*   **Environmental Conservation**: Environmental organizations and
    conservationists can use Ground to capture ecological data, map migration
    routes or habitats, and discover and mitigate the effects of environmental
    change.

*   **Resource Management**: Using Ground, communities can manage resources in
    conditions of scarcity, such as droughts or food shortages. Individuals can
    report on the status of shared infrastructure, and relief and recovery teams
    can assess and determine the best distribution of available aid.

*   **Social Analysis**: Sociologists and students can use Ground to collect and
    analyze population data, community growth, and other social factors.
    Researchers can use Ground to encourage the direct participation of
    communities in the research process.

*   **Civic Engagement**: Ground can enhance civic participation by equipping
    policy makers, community groups, and institutions with the data they need to
    assess public sentiment and enact change. Civic organizations can use Ground
    to facilitate civic engagement, poll citizenry, and analyze the political
    landscape.

*   **Traditional Knowledge Preservation** Using Ground, indigenous communities
    can record place-based traditional knowledge, skills, and practices. Ground
    empowers stewards of tradition to incorporate sites of cultural and natural
    significance into land management and community development decisions.
    Communities can use Ground to assist their collaborations with community
    knowledge holders on field trips and during interviews.
